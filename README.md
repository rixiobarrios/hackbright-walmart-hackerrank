# Hackbright/Walmart Technical Assessment Prep

The next step is the online Hackerrank Technical Assessment.

Ideally applicants have about 40+ hours of study and practice in a scripting language like Python or JavaScript. We want you to be familiar with control flow and looping, creating and manipulating basic datatypes (integers, strings, booleans, etc.), creating and manipulating lists/arrays to store basic datatypes, creating and calling functions, algorithmic problem-solving, and conditional logic. I've included some resources below for you to utilize in your preparation.

- [Codecademy.com]() 
- [Dash by General Assembly]()  
- [FreeCodeCamp.org]()
- [Coursera's Python For Everybody]() 
- [Python.org Python Tutorial]()

The technical assessment is an online assessment that will test your knowledge of the skills listed above! You can take this assessment in any language supported by HackerRank. For details, you can refer to the complete list of HackerRank’s coding environments [here](). 

## Hackbright/Walmart Skill Verification

The purpose of this Skill Verification is to further get to know you, and the wonderful skill-set you displayed in the HackerRank assessment. This will be a scheduled live meeting held via Zoom that will require you to be on both Video and Audio. We invite you to schedule this important next step in the admissions process ASAP using the link below.

Click [here](https://calendly.com/hackbright-proctors/proctored-coding-session?month=2023-03) to book your spot. 

After you complete this next step, applicants that pass will be invited to complete a one-on-one admissions consultation with a member of the Hackbright Academy admissions team. Please review the information below to learn more about the technical assessment and learn what to expect next.

### What happens during this interview?

During this session, you will join a small group of other applicants. Once everyone joins, you will go into a breakout room and work individually on a coding problem via a HackerRank interview coding pad. The problem you will be asked to solve will involve any of the following syntax areas.

- Variables and basic data types (strings, integers, booleans)
- If-statements
- For-loops
- Lists or arrays
- Basic functions

You may use any coding language to create your solution. During or near the end of the interview, the proctor will hop into your break out room and ask you to explain the code you wrote and answer some questions about it.

### So, is this a group interview?

No, this is not a group interview. You will be in a small group at the beginning but after receiving your instructions, you will go into an individual break out room. The proctor will visit you 1-2 times during the interview.

### How will I be evaluated?

You will be evaluated holistically on both your syntax recall and your ability to make progress on the problem. Partial credit will be awarded where appropriate.

### Can you tell me more about the coding question?

The problem will be a similar difficulty level to the final problems on the HackerRank assessment you have already completed. We will record the zoom session and also the code you write in the coding pad so that we can grade your performance accurately afterwards.

### Is there a time limit?

You will have roughly 25 minutes to complete the problem. It is intended to take about 15 minutes total, so that you have plenty of time to think and problem solve (and provide some explanation to the proctor).

### How can I prepare?

We don’t expect that people prepare any more for this stage of the interview. You’re ready! That said, if you are wanting to do a practice problem, here is a good one.

Write a function that takes in a list or an array of numbers. The function should return the sum of any numbers from the list that are either greater than 10 or less than 5.

### What comes next?

Applicants who pass this assessment will then schedule a complete a one-on-one admissions consultation with a member from the Hackbright Academy admissions team. From there, your application will be reviewed by Walmart for an admissions decision.
